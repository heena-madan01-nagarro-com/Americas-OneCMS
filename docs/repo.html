<h1 style="color: #2e6c80;">Repository Structure:</h1>
<p>Each brand will have its own code reposiory for development. As we know Adobe supports single code repository deployment so we would be creating one single code repository which is replica of adobe cloud repository. Each brand's code would be synced to this single code repository.</p>
<p>After complete code quality checks, a github sync action would be triggered to sync Adobe Cloud Git code from this repository.</p>
